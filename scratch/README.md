# machine-learning

Here I follow the following book and implement the algorithms therein from scratch as a means to learn the subject.
Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference by Dr Simon J. D. Prince https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107011795/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_.jwjAbJCPWTQR

### EM algorithms (discrete & continuous latent variables)
  - Generalities
  - Gaussian Mixture (discrete mixture)
